# REALTIME_POTHOLE_DETECTION

In this project, real time pothole detection using fully connected neural network as a classifier is being used .
This is a end-to-end project implemented in .ipynb checkpoint is being created .
In the first classifier , the classifier has achieved .97 auroc value and in the second classifier :*Classifier2: Global Average Pooling Model* has achieved only 0.92
auroc.
So, we will consider 1st classifier as  a final one .
